# THE EPIC DUNGEOMON FIGHT  -                GAME PROJECT

Hello everyone, this is my first IronHack Bootcamp project. I created a game using just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Putting together two games that I love: Pokemon and Dungeon & Dragons.

## About the game:

The game is an epic battle of D&D monsters and heroes, follow the link to play the game and don't forget to play the music at the bottom of the page for full immersion.

In the middle of the screen there are buttons that are the attacks of each monster/hero. But be careful, just like pokemon, they have weaknesses, resistances and immunities! See if it's worth setting fire to an Ancient Red Dragon... You can Press F5 for more random battles!


##  So, what is the story?

A wild monster (or hero) appears, FIGHT TO THE DEATH  !
